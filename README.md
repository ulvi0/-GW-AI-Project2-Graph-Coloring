## Task description
You are given a graph in the form of a text file, that you are supposed to color.  The proper vertex coloring 
is such that each vertex is assigned a color and no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color.

Write  a  CSP  algorithm  to  solve  this  coloring  problem.    The  CSP  algorithm  should  have  the  following 
components: 
• Search algorithm to solve the CSP 
• Heuristics (min remaining values, least constraining value) 
• Constraint propagation using AC3.
